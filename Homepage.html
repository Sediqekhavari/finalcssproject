            <p>Afghanistan is a country in Central Asia, the 41st largest country in the world and has a population of 40 million. Pashto and Dari are the official languages ​​of the country.
                Afghanistan contains the remains of many architectural styles from different periods, including Greek and Buddhist stupas, monasteries, historical monuments, temples, mosques and Islamic minarets.
                The most famous of these are the Great Mosque of Herat, the Blue Mosque, the Minaret of Jam, the Forty Steps of Kandahar, the Bast Castle in Lashkar Gah, the Alexandria of Amu or Oxus (Shahr Ai-Khanum) and the Alexandria of Herat (Qalaa Ikhtiaruddin). However, many of those historical monuments have been damaged in modern times due to civil wars.
                The cuisine of Afghanistan is mainly based on the country's staple crops such as wheat, millet, barley and rice. They are accompanied by indigenous fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy products such as milk, yogurt and curd. Kabuli pilaf is the national dish of Afghanistan.
                Afghanistan is known for its pomegranates, grapes and sweet melons.
                Afghanistan is generally made up of four main ethnic groups: Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks, as well as other ethnic minorities.</p><br><br>
