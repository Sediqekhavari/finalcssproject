            <P>Ghazni is a city in Afghanistan that was the capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty, and Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni spent years trying to develop and expand it. The city of Ghazni is famous for its star-shaped minarets. They date back to the mid-12th century and are a remnant of the Bahram Shah Mosque.
                The most important tomb in Ghazni is the tomb of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Other tombs include the tombs of poets and scientists, such as Abu Raihan Biruni and Sana'i. Ghazni has the largest mines in the region. Ghazni's lithium reserves account for 30% of the world's lithium.
                 In addition, fine industries such as coppersmithing, goldsmithing, and other handicrafts are thriving in this land.</P>
